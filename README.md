# CodeClause_Covid_analysis
STEP 1: - Load the dataset.
First, as we all know power BI support various types of file, it can be in the form of web, csv, xlsx. Here I have loaded csv file from Kaggle.

STEP 2:- Preprocess the data
This data set contain various column which were not necessary so we have removed the unwanted column. This make our data clean and it also reduces the size of file.

STEP 3:- Adding some columns
With the help of Confirmed, Death, Recovered column we have created 2 new Measure called as Fatality rate, and Recovery rate.

STEP 4:- Creating Dashboard
By using Card, Stacked column chart, Table, and map visual we have created the Dashboard for our analysis. This helps us to analyze the data set properly

STEP 5:-Creating tooltip
In this step we have created a new page tooltip, this will help us to visualize stacked column chart more accurately as it will contain the detail information about the cases in particular country.
